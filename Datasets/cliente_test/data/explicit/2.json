Bala \"Me Too Can Read\"", "helpful": [12, 14], "reviewText": "For sheer intensity and plot topsy-turvies, no other show comes close to 24. You'd think the premise (every hour of the 24 episode-long season is played in real-time; thus 24 encapsulates a full day) would get old by now, but, surprisingly, the producers and writers have managed to come up with another riveting, must-see season. In fact, this might be the best season of them all. The thrills and nail-biting suspense (as well as the SPOILERS alert) begin early in the season five opener, with the shocking slaying of President Palmer and assassination attempts on familiar CTU agents (one of which is tragically successful). Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) is lured out of hiding after 18 months and becomes rapidly embroiled in a devious conspiracy that goes all the way up to the White House. As he becomes the most wanted man in America (he is framed for Palmer's assassination), he must try to ferret out the true culprit(s) and again save the country from deadly Russian extremists and various domestic villains. On a personal level, he must come to terms with the deaths of personal friends, the alienation of his daughter Kim, and the fact that his former girlfriend  Audrey Raines (Kim Raver) might have moved on.There's a reason why Kiefer won the best dramatic actor Emmy and why 24 beat out the likes of the West Wing, the Sopranos, Grey's Anatomy, and House for best drama. The fifth season is fully serviced by a coming together of story and acting - from the gripping, edge-of-your-seat plot line, with its manic twists and turns, to the no-quarters-given, full speed ahead performances of the cast, but specially of Kiefer Sutherland, who gives his all in inhabiting his role. Kiefer IS the show and consistently produces such driven intensity, lying just beneath an icy cold surface, and yet his eyes reveal a vulnerability of sorts, when he's reacting to something personal to him. He makes a scene work, even without dialogue. Very good stuff. And, no, you do not want to get in the way of Jack Bauer.There are other standouts, of course. Gregory Itzin as the shifty and weak-willed U.S. President makes you gleefully hiss, while Jean Smart as the medicated First Lady Martha Logan brings earnest soap-opera acting to primetime. Mary Lynn Rajskub (Chloe O'Brian) continues her highlight role as CTU's brilliant but cantankerous and socially-inept tech support operative. Meanwhile, James Morrison, Roger Cross, Kim Raver, Carlos Bernard, Louis Lombardi, and Sean Astin become the season's dependable, solid bedrock.That so many of the regular cast die in this season lends an immediacy to the episodes and exponentially raises the stakes. There's no comfort level at all here, as you're never sure who would survive in the end (but, with this show, were you ever sure?). Even Kiefer Sutherland had played around with the idea of having Jack Bauer biting the dust (Please, no!).So, the 24 - Season Five dvd box releases December 5, 2006, just in time for you to go thru 'em to prep for season six, which begins next January on Fox. Season Six, by the way, picks up nearly two years after season five's finale and will have James Cromwell with a recurring role as Jack's estranged dad, Phillip Bauer. Also joining the cast is Eddie Izzard, Kal Penn (Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle), Peter MacNicol, Regina King, and the beautiful Rena Sofer. I can't wait to own season five and, then, to see season six. Long live Jack Bauer!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Possibly the best 24 yet", "unixReviewTime": 1159660800, "reviewTime": "10 1, 2006"}

For he is a god amongst men and he is deserving of all praise that can possibly be heaped upon him. The one time the Emmys got something right!! Jack Bauer is as close as any fictional character has become to being superhumanly powerful, and at some times his recurrent circumvention of the bureaucratic system, assaulting his friends and co-workers, his flagrant abuse of \"prisoner's rights\" and his uncanny ability to fight his way out of any trap... it may require a little bit more suspension of disbelief than would normally be necessary in a lesser show, but the very core of this show is Jack Bauer, or more specifially, Kiefer Sutherland and his increasingly better performance each season of 24. When he is having a particularly emotional moment, you feel it exude from the screen.... this is just an example of the power that Sutherland brings to this show. Also standing out as always is Mary Lynn Rasjkub as the wonderfully ascerbic and wicked-tongued Chloe O'Brien. The introduction of her character is one of the best things that's happened to this show. But this season has some other stand-out characters: one that was introduced in season 4 and a brand new one. Fans of the show know these as President Charles Logan (the wonderfully slimy Gregory Itzin) and his first lady Martha Logan (the amazing Jean Smart). Their interplay and their performances are almost as key as Sutherland in this season. Another thing that came to be almost an in-joke is that three members of the cast of the original ROBOCOP film appear in different parts of the series, which as a fan of that film was just really cool to see. Whether or not that was intended, it's still a nice touch for genre fans. Julian Sands has lots of fun chewing up scenery as the evil Russian-yet-English-Accented Terrorist. The premise is per usual: Jack must defy all odds to save the country and avenge his personal losses. But the plot itself is of a higher level of complexity and tragedy this season than prior seasons. The way it begins is ALMOST as shocking as the way the season ends.

It's fast-paced, big-budgeted, over-the-top (sometimes WAAAAAAAY over-the-top), and mostly clever. But I don't think ANY of the previous seasons (or the lame season 6) can come even close to the excitment and joy of watching this fifth season.Yes this season follows the same (tired) gimick of everything happening in real-time, but what set this season apart for me was it's more focusd plot-line. Several of lead character Jack Bauer's friends are killed or attacked and he's out to find out who and get revenge. Ok, sometimes the overall story arch DOES get side-tracked to the typical (terrorists trying to release poisonous gas), and sometimes it's not always that interesting (CTU gets infiltrated AGAIN!). But none of these side-attractions even BEGIN to take-away from the exciting central story which pushes along at break-neck speed and crediblilty (thanks also to the believable performances of the ENTIRE cast).Like some people I try not to watch the show on TV and much prefer to wait for the DVD to come out which is why I can't recommend buying this season enough (thought why there's not subtitles on every episode is beyond me).

I sure don't remember the explanation of who knew Jack was alive at the beginning of the season.  Maybe it was mentioned and I missed it.  Furthermore, we have yet more examples of lack of security at CTU.  While it does make for gripping drama, it does seem like they could come up with a new plot trick every so often.My biggest complaint this season was the body count.  We lost several key characters from previous years.  While I understand the producer's desire to keep us on the edge of our seats, can't anyone from the show live happily ever after?

Have just finished watching the first 5 seasons (something of a marathon over the last month).Season 5 is probably my favorite season to date. It starts strong and doesn't let up until it's over.As to packaging and the discs themselves: the first 4 seasons come in fold-out packaging + outer sleeve, much like the Highlander series and a few others. The first discs contain the episodes themselves, and the last disc contains some bonus materials. Season 5, however, breaks from this tradition and instead packages the discs in 4 slim cases (the 4th holds the bonus features disc). A change of page in packaging, but still quite attractive, with approximately the same shelf footprint (if not slightly smaller).Season 5 continues to do a good job with chapter breaks, scene selection menus, and bonus features. I might note however, they've added a slightly longer intro before getting to the main menu (looks like booting up and logging into a CTU computer system). However, on my DVD player I could skip ahead without having to play the whole sequence. So, it wasn't completely ungainly.The video and audio were up to par. Of course I don't have a large-screen/wide-screen TV nor surround sound, so I can't test under all conditions. But if there were any video or audio issues I didn't notice them. Perhaps some moire/color issues in scenes with close parallel-line patterns. But I've noticed that on any number of DVD releases of other series from other studios, so I wouldn't say there was any more in 24 than other series.Overall, I highly recommend this for anyone who hasn't seen 24, and who likes the spy/thriller type show.

The fifth season of \"24\" revolves around one central mystery: who killed an ex-president and how is Jack Bauer connected to the assassination? It's a thrilling season--probably the best since the first season--and it comes to a stunning conclusion that will be answered in January of 2007. Interestingly after having watched \"Casino Royale\" its clear that the new Bond film was inspired by shows like \"24\" which were, in turn, inspired by early Bond and some of the newer spy thrillers out there. There are a number of twists and turns in this season set my advice is NOT to read any reviews that summarize anymore of the plot if you haven't seen this season as there are some major spoilers in some of the reviews that follow.As usual Fox has put together a terrific DVD. This also features a brief episode \"prequel\" to the sixth season like previous sets had. We get a large amount of worthwhile commentary tracks including some with Emmy winner Kiefer Sutherland. There's also a summary of the season included as well athough if you've watched the show (or are watching it now) it won't really provide anything new. Th \"100 Episode Reel\" is a pretty useless extra -- basically a clips compilation.Different places are offering different exclusives. If you purchase it here you can download a free episode from Unbox (at least during the Holidays) while Target also offers a limited edition bonus disc for this set with additional featurettes on the show. Regardless of whether you buy it here at amazon.com or elsewhere this set features plenty of extras including an examination of the wonderful Presidential retreat featured in the show, a good featurette on the stellar work by the cinematography on the show, a featurette on the supporting actors on the show as well as extended and deleted scenes. I haven't had a chance to dig through all the bonus material yet but it what I have checked out looks really, really good.This set is packaged in the thinpak holders with two discs per holder so the accordian style packaging has been abandoned for this thinner packaging. This is a terrific set for an outstanding season of the series.What I would love to see if Keifer Sutherland and Donald Sutherland featured during a season.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fifth season the finest since the first", "unixReviewTime": 1165449600, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2006"}

However, Season Five brings some of the attention back to the sitting U.S. President (this time Charles Logan) and ends up with a much more well-rounded storyline.For a basic (non-spoilery) plot summary, a group of Russian terrorists threaten to release canisters of nerve gas in the U.S., leading Bauer to be reprieved from his thought-to-be death in order to help stop the crisis.  As CTU begins investigating the terrorism, however, it quickly becomes clear that the terrorists are working with a high-ranking government official, and the conspiracy begins to be unraveled.To be honest, at first I was skeptical of all the focus on President Logan, as didn't like his character and wasn't sure that he could command the camera as well as his predecessor Palmer.  However, by the end of the season, Logan is easily the most enjoyable/interesting character on the show.  His acting, along with his wife, chief of staff, and head of security, really gives the show the Presidential presence it lacked since that first season.Of course, there is still more than enough of Jack Bauer and his fellow CTU agents (Audrey Rains, Bill Buchanon, Edgar Stiles, Chloe O'Brien, etc.) to go around, which means that intense drama ensues in every single episode.  The writers have an amazing way to take a character that looks like a creep (think Tony Almeida and George Mason in the early seasons) and, by the end of a few episodes, have him become a noble hero, and that tradition continues in this season as well.The only \"knock\" I have on this season is that the cliffhanger endings of each episodes aren't quite as shocking (e.g. Nina Myers doesn't appear out of nowhere).  However, I think that was more of a creative choice by the writers, as the story is actually more coherent that any season besides the first one.  Instead of seemingly changing the plot of the show with every episode, Season Five slowly crescendos until the big finale.So, fans of 24 can purchase this season with confidence knowing that they will still get their action, drama, suspense, and some great twists and turns along the way.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Back To Its Political Roots", "unixReviewTime": 1241049600, "reviewTime": "04 30, 2009"}

And to try to throw alot at us, NCIS gets a new director, Jenny Shepard played by Lauren Holly. Now Shepard and Gibbs do have some history, since both were partners at NCIS at one time, also. To proclaim Ari's innocence, is Massade officer Ziva David. And I'm sorry, I didn't like her then. And I don't liker her now, She and pretty much all of Massad is built up like they are the only agents that are extremely tough, they're unstoppable. So Ziva and Jenny try to convince Gibbs that he's wrong, and Gibbs even makes the only logical argument against Ari's innocence. That if he were innocent, he would turn himself in. So, after much arguing, he gets Ziva to follow him. And Ziva kills Ari in Gibb's basement, And we get each persons view of how they saw Kate in this episode. Now, I would have inserted Paula Cassidy to the team after this. Since there was some obvious chemistry between her and tony, but no. We get Ziva, and she is built up like I said. As this unstoppable, lean mean killing machine. The best of the best, and I'm sorry, but she's abrasive and annoying. And I still have a hard time accepting her to the team, Gibbs magically trusts her more than any other member of the team. season three is a good season, and Ziva is the on;y reason I didn't give it 5 stars. Although season three does end with almost getting blown up, going into a coma. Waking up from that coma, and thinking it's 1991. And we get to meet Gibbs's mentor, Mike Franks. Which leads to gibbs trying to stop a terrorists attack. Only the generals won't allow it, and Gibbs ends up Quitting NCIS. All in all, season three is still awsome.

As each of them has their various moments throughout the season from killing an undercover cop, to a prisoner dying in custody or a mentally deranged ex-boyfriend that just won't go away.Along with some cool special features, NCIS is a show that is best watched from the beginning so that you get the full effect.

Cote de Pablo joins the team as the beautiful and dangerous Israeli Mossad Agent Ziva David, while veteran actress Lauren Holly, as Jenny Shepard, becomes the new director of NCIS.The changes put iconic Senior Agent Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon) in the awkward situation of working in a new agent while getting used to a new boss who is a former love interest.  The rest of the team, still grieving for Caitlin, are slow to embrace Ziva but will be won over by her obvious competence, and by her hilarious efforts to master American slang.  Wisecracking Agent Tony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly)in particular will find that Ziva forces him to raise his game in a way that Caitlin never quite did.The exciting two-part season opener resolves the still-open case of Agent Todd's murder.  A two-part season ender places Gibbs' service with NCIS at risk.  The audience will learn more about Gibbs' past while contemplating another season-ending cliff-hanger.  In between, the team will handle serial killers, terrorists, and kidnappings with its usual mixture of brisk police procedural and entertaining repartee.
