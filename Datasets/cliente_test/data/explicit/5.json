It leaves a more haunting, memorable trail than most movies in the genre. But in between its first and its lasting impressions, it somewhat loses its way in the dark.Too much goes unexplained. For example, we see John Leguizamo stranded in his darkened movie theater one minute - then we next see him lying battered and bruised in an illuminated bus stop shelter. What happened to get him there? In his commentary, Director Anderson says that there was some scripting that would have explained Leguizamo's trajectory, but a variety of constraints prevented this explanation from becoming part of the film. Actually, Anderson thought this was all to the good though - that some things were best left to the imagination. I'm not so sure about that. It seems Leguizamo's navigation of the engulfing, vanquishing night would have been one of the processes most interesting to watch. Without showing such process, the film too often ends up being just abrupt, choppy, and undeveloped.It also has too many lapses of logic. The creeping darkness doesn't play fair. It shifts its rules of engagement, overwhelming one person, while allowing another similarly situated person to survive, at least for a while. Well, that could be an additional aspect of the evil of the darkness. It toys randomly with its victims, like a cat may or may not toy with a mouse, sheerly on a whim.Then I had one of my common technical complaints about this film. The DVD often projected as an indecipherable smudge on my TV screen. So it ran as murky rather than sinisterly dark. There is something about the final lighting/filtering process that many modern filmmakers use that causes their movies to be a chore to watch on home TV's. I wish filmmakers would get back to whatever technology was used from the 1920's through the 1960's that allows their films to play as appropriately shaded rather than just obscure when run on a TV screen.The Director's commentary doesn't add a lot to a viewer's appreciation of the film. Brad Anderson starts out sounding too much like Ben Stein, making a dreary, nasal drone of his narrative. So unless you have a lot of spare time, you can probably skip the commentary and most of the other extras, except for the interviews.However the Director's commentary does highlight at least one telling aspect of this film and its making. Anderson talks about how apt it was to settle on Detroit as a location for the action. The City itself is perhaps the most fascinating character in the entire movie. It becomes an icon of our crumbling economy, our crumbling culture. Some of the scenes in the movie call for shots of major urban intersections shown desolate, abandoned, post-apocalyptic. Anderson said that he hardly had to clear Detroit's streets and highways of cars and people for these scenes. They are already so often eerily null. So many buildings are already hollow, echoing shells of once vital industries. These shots in and of themselves served as chilling prognostications of what can in reality befall all our cheery, oblivious bustle.So this movie is overall worth watching - for its darkling premise, and for its stunning views of Detroit.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Too Often Leaves Us in the Dark", "unixReviewTime": 1308355200, "reviewTime": "06 18, 2011"}

Unfortunately, the special features are some of the worst inclusions I have seen on a film like this, and the only thing giving this some higher marks was the 7.1 DTS.The story follows four people wallowing through their idiocies in trying to survive some unknown catastrophe that leaves a city (played by Detroit - which was a better character than everyone here) devoid of people. Some bad CGI shadows follow them around trying to gobble them up sans their clothing. I would have to say some typecasting has to occur here when you have Hayden Christiansen walking around with a hood barely showing his face for several sequences, followed by someone holding a long green glow stick baring resemblance to a certain weapon Hayden might be carrying in some other franchise. But anyway, the supplements are all in lodef and I listed all of the bad ones first:* Alternate endings, 3 or 4 at 8:20 minutes. Please take my advice and skip these. They are no different except for one alternate camera angle and a different sunset - nothing changes from the film.* Revealing 7th Street (making of), 7:04 minutes. Talking heads & really bad insight by the cast on the film and story.* Creating the Mood of 7th, 7:04 minutes. They essentially took the cuts from the first one and made this longer one, but with reasons for why they chose Detroit. Which I have to say I am not sure if all of the reasoning made Detroit seem worse (\"gothic\", \"Dead\" etc.), or they just didn't realize they were saying it.* Behind the scenes montage, 2:11 minutes. Several identical cuts from the other two quips, with no dialogue. Would be best as a workbook for the staff of the film, otherwise a complete skipper.* HDNet Promo, 4:19 minutes (In HD). The standard trailer length plug.* Fangoria Interviews, 2 @ 31 minutes. This was actually an insightful and thorough interview process and was better than the commentary. Thankfully, Brad takes up 22 minutes of the set and will be worth the watch for his fans. Jacob's lasts only a few minutes and the rest is clips of the film.* Dig Copy, not disc dependent.* Commentary, see Fangoria interview instead.I was not impressed with the film, the bad effects that shined through on BD, or the ending being given away on the cover art (so no surprise for me, that ending sucked anyway) but I was impressed with the 7.1 - maybe only getting used by the creature sounds at various times, but a nice immersion.

This, in no way, is meant to say that the service is lacking. It is a great one. this is reviewing the movie.In the city, strange things are taking place.

Overnight, people literally leave their homes and vanish, taking nothing.

That was a couple of weeks ago and I should have written a review then, perhaps saving some people money. I apologize for that but I normally do not do the negative route. Still, this is a terrible way to fleece peolple with a good idea and terrible execution.What you have here is a tale of two proverbial cities, with one going off greatly in the storyline department and then taking a sudden turn and going down boring Street. I know - I have been there before and recognized the signs. I watched it with two other people as well, and they concurred. A lot of things went wrong and made this awful.You start with people going away in a weird way and people asking why. The main actors hang in there through this, and it all seems good. Then you have some of the scenes that try to keep people out of the shadows, some that made it seem as though the world is really hard to understand, and even when the vanishings start to make sense it hurts to watch it progress. The writers are at fault in a lot of this, and the direction hurts as well. What you have is an \" o no, avoid that shadow\" story mingling with a really boring output from the actors. Overacting is a theme as well as trying to make you scared of the nothing that is really not menacing, and it gets old fast.

The thriller drama (directed by Brad Anderson, much better \"The Machinist\") begins with a great premise, building up the tension in the first fifteen minutes until it suddenly loses steam, having nothing new or interesting to add to the thin story that goes nowhere.The opening sequence is just brilliant. Paul (understated and effective John Leguizamo) is a projectionist working at a packed Detroit theater. Then, suddenly the light fails. The next moment Paul finds himself alone (well, almost) in the silent theater - everyone is gone, perhaps everyone in the entire city. The fact is, Paul - and a news reporter Luke (Hayden Christensen), a therapist Rosemary (Thandie Newton) and a young boy named James (Jacob Latimore) - are among the \"survivors\" of the mysterious blackout.In this kind of suspense (like \"The Birds\") you don't have to explain everything, as long as you can keep the viewers interested in what is going on. Unfortunately this does not happen in \"Vanishing on 7th Street.\" Information is given bit by bit - long nights, a man in Chicago, the Roanoke Colony, and most importantly, rules for survival - but they add up to nothing. Characters attempt to theorize about the meaning of total \"wipeout,\" but what they talk about is just dull. Some ideas are directly borrowed from other apocalyptic horror movies.

Amazon, Hulu, Netflix, etc.THE SHOW... possibly the most beautiful actress alive, Sarah Shahi plays a &#34;negotiator&#34; Kate at a law firm.  A lawyer who has sworn off &#34;law&#34; per se.  The show has plenty of tension and drama going on with her partner at Reed and Reed... her stepmother (after her father has died), an ex-husband that is an off and on sexual or love/hate interest, who is also in conflict with her as the prosecutor who routinely is a challenge to her professional life.  Kate also has a love hate relationship with a despicable 3rd partner who Kate also has mixed relationship type feelings. Apparently a true Mr. Darcy but you'll never know because this network sucks. All this while each show has the additional drama of Kate trying to negotiate and 'solve' seemingly impossible conflicts where a trial is trying to be avoided. It would still be pretty fun to watch but keep in mind as soon as you really really love this show... it abruptly ends, cancelled, without anything near a conclusion.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Whoever cancelled this show need a mind enema", "unixReviewTime": 1374624000, "reviewTime": "07 24, 2013"}

Developing the characters are difficult because the whole basis for the storyline is so unusual.  A werewolf who ran away from home after being turned into one, a Vampire turned during the Revolutionary war, and a Ghost as main characters who through the &#34;wisdom&#34; of the aged vampire decide to try and live together and help each other to live as close to a normal human existence as possible.  Vamps and werewolves are natural enemies making it odd, the Ghost a bit clueless yet they somehow bond as friends even though they don't really do a lot to help each other out in dealing with their own form of difficulties in being a monster trying to be more human.  Somehow the writing is good enough that it held my interest enough to watch it.  There are some interesting twists introduced in the stories that you really would never think of unless thinking of this in  a comical situation, but it isn't a comedy.  I'm not really sure what it is, but season one fumbles through each of them living together frequently enough to at least become a support system to each other in their attempts to be human when not.  In doing so it develops enough that it held my interest through the first two seasons.  Since SyFy only makes 13 episode seasons character development is something that has to occur as the story develops because there aren't enough episodes to give us any background and so it is written into episodes as flashbacks and fragmented memories of the past, and the present as the past intersects with the present.  I'm watching the third season now, so the show has held my attention through not with the enthusiasm of most SyFy shows I like.  But I do keep watching, there is a unique aspect to the show that no other has touched on and has its entertaining moments.  It is different, and good enough that I've watched it.  If not for being able to stream it I NEVER would have made it through the first season on TV.  But streaming you get your answers faster so shows that aren't as good deliver faster just because your watching them back to back from historical seasons.  I think that is the saving aspect of Being Human is that I'm streaming it and able to watch a season fairly quick so it holds my attention.

It's the description of \"Being Human,\" a bittersweet little drama about a little supernatural gang trying to live their lives in an mundane world. It starts off similar to the original BBC series, but soon branches off in its own dark direction.Vampire Aidan (Sam Witwer) and his werewolf buddy Josh (Sam Huntington) move into a nice rented house in Boston. But they find themselves with a third roommate -- a ghost named Sally (Meaghan Rath) who was engaged to their landlord until she died. George and Mitchell work a pair of low-level hospital jobs, and attempt to do normal things like date, join the neighborhood watch, and pal around with kids.However, the trio still have supernatural problems. Josh struggles to reunite with his family despite his lycanthropy, and has a relationship go very awry. As Sally struggles to deal with being dead, she discovers that her fiancee did something unspeakable to her. And Aidan's life is disrupted by the city's overlord, Bishop (Mark Pellegrino), who is planning something major for the vampire population -- and will allow no one to stand in his way.The obvious question about \"Being Human\" is: how does it stack up beside the original BBC version? Well, it sticks pretty closely to the BBC series' storylines for the first few episodes, but with more episodes to flesh things out in, it branches out in some new directions, with some new characters and events introduced to the story (such as a little boy whose friendship with Aidan ends in tragedy).And this series maintains much of the flavor of the original series: clever comedy based on the idea of three supernaturals living \"normal\" lives (Aidan vamps out during a family dinner) and personal drama, while also delving into the painful issues of temptation, loss, and what it means to be human. The entire season is cloaked in bittersweet reflection, especially since the characters' attempts to be \"normal\" keep tripping up.As for the actors, they're all pretty solid. Witwer is all gothic dimply charm, and he wrenches your heart during some of Aidan's sadder moments; Huntington's Josh is an endearingly earnest nerd, but he does get a bit whiny sometimes; and Rath's Sally is pretty, flaky and has some issues with her relationships. And Pellegrino is wonderfully, silkily Machievellian as the leader of the island, Jacob...

I take great pleasure in watching the horrifically poor monster movies that they produce, as well as shows like \"Eureka\", which is one of my all time favorites. I mention this only because when I started watching \"Being Human\" on Netflix, I was confused. The production values were so high, I thought I must have been mistaken about it being a SyFy show. I googled it, and sure enough... it was produced for SyFy, but it seems like it was made for one of the major networks, such care was taken in its manufacture. In no way do I mean this as a slight against SyFy's other, much cheesier productions.At first, I had somewhat mixed feelings about \"Being Human\". The vampire character, Aidan, came off as being terribly cliched and boring. I couldn't believe that yet another story was going to include the stereotypical vampire: pale, dark haired, handsome, moody, full of angst, etc. Likewise, the ghost character, Sally, seemed like a spoiled brat with the sole purpose of whining at every possible opportunity. Yet... I kept watching. Part of the reason for my perseverance was that the story seemed to have great potential (which proved true), and another big reason was that the werewolf character, Josh, was incredibly endearing. His goofy, awkward waddling through life made up for the pissing and moaning of his two roommates.Fortunately, as the season progressed, I grew to have great empathy for all three of these characters. Miraculously, Aidan was salvaged and became somebody that I both admired and empathized with, which is definitely a first in my book, as far as moody, privileged vampires go. I also grew to care for Sally, and empathized with her plight as a spirit caught between worlds, struggling for peace and retribution. Josh continued to appeal to me, and my initial fondness for his character only grew.What is perhaps even more remarkable, on the subject of characters, is how well the lesser ones are developed and brought to life. Bishop, the primary villain, is a monster that truly radiates charisma. Despite his horrible deeds, I could not help but empathize with him, and even root for him at times. Other characters who appear occasionally, such as Ray, are also brought to life with great care and a conflicted array of emotions that is compelling to watch.\"Being Human\" does a great job of creating an engaging, enjoyable episode for each week during its first season. More importantly, the continuing story arc was told in excellent fashion, never shying away from embracing REAL consequence, interesting questions, and just the right tone of mystery and mayhem.

I loved the show's concept and the over-arching plot kept me hooked all through the first season. Unfortunately it also had a lot of sketchy characterizations and unconvincing moments that can plague a high-concept show (especially one just starting out). While I wouldn't call this U.S. remake \"better\" than the original (and I'm not sure how necessary it is with the original still airing and available in the U.S.) it does manage to avoid some of it's pitfalls and is a pretty entertaining show in it's own right.The story of 'Being Human' revolves around Vampire Aidan, Werewolf Josh and Ghost Sally who share an apartment while trying to lead normal \"human\" lives. All three have their weaknesses and much like original show their \"conditions\" are treated like curses instead of gifts (Aidan's still addicted to living blood, Josh can't control his transformations, Sally can't interact with anyone outside these two). The plot of this first season more-or-less follows the original's story with Aidan's conflicts with his mentor/tormentor Bishop (the vampire who turned him) fueling the best episodes. We do get a lot more exposition with this U.S. remake (being 13 episodes instead of the original six) and everything is played out a bit more reserved than the original show but it does lack some of the biting-humor and freshness the UK series had.Much like the writing and directing, the characterizations in the U.S. 'Being Human' are dialed-down but I found them a bit more palatable (and likable). I was caring about Aidan, Josh and Sally right off the bat thanks to the performances by Sam Witwer, Sam Huntington and Meaghan Rath. The best performance comes from Mark Pellegrino as Bishop and the scenes between him and Witwer really crank up the suspense (especially in the season finale).All in all I found the U.S. 'Being Human' a very entertaining show. If you're a fan of the original I can't say there's a lot to be impressed with here (and some of the changes will probably seem unnecessary) but if you're interested in the premise or just looking for a good supernatural series that isn't ripping off 'True Blood' or 'Supernatural' I'd recommend giving this first-season of 'Being Human' a chance.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "An entertaining remake.....", "unixReviewTime": 1321142400, "reviewTime": "11 13, 2011"}

Harris \"Film aficionado\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "Having watched every season of the British hit \"Being Human,\" I was a bit wary of SyFy's American reinterpretation. After all, for every successful translation (The Office) of a British gem, there are dozens of failed attempts (Coupling). While I'm sure that I will anger the many avid fans of the original show, I will say that its first season (for me) was wildly uneven. I enjoyed the progress into later years as the plotting became darker and more complex--but while the show had an initial charm, it wasn't perfectly formed right out of the gate. So I was open-minded to this reboot. While some loyalists will contend that it is an utter failure and some newbies will proclaim it is brilliant, I fall squarely in the middle. Once again, I find myself thinking this is a good show with the potential to grow into something far richer and more rewarding. The British version started as an enjoyment and turned into great television. I think that the U.S. version has the same opportunity.For those new to the concept of \"Being Human,\" it is perhaps one of the most unique and (let's admit it) most ridiculous ones on TV. In its outrageousness, however, it is completely irresistible! What if a ghost, a werewolf, and a vampire shared living quarters as best mates? You think the trials of tribulations of being young and attractive in the big city makes for great drama--try adding this supernatural component for a bit of fun. Sam Witwer has an intensity perfectly suited to the role of a tortured blood sucker. Sam Huntington has a goofy appeal as a befuddled werewolf. And Meaghan Rath is a serviceable and pleasant apparition. In my opinion, the cast between the two versions is on a relatively even playing field. I actually prefer Witwer in Season One, Rath is somewhat blander yet also less annoying, and Huntington (while incredibly likable) has a hard time measuring up Russell Tovey's pitch perfect creation. Don't get me wrong. I really appreciate Huntington's easy charm, but Tovey (with Sinead Keenan as Nina) give two of the most underrated performances on contemporary British TV.The premise of the show is that the three roomies crave normalcy above all else. But it's not an easy road. The first couple of episodes stick very firmly to the British template, but then the scripts branch out in a welcome way. Primary plot points in this season include Huntington's courtship of a new girlfriend, Rath's investigation into her untimely death, and Witwer's political struggle trying to extricate himself from a vampiric organization. Witwer's plot line has the most meat and is very well done. With terrific character pieces by Mark Pellegrino and Terry Kinney, this arc is the primary reason to catch this incarnation of \"Being Human.\" The trio of leads plays off one another with ease, but have yet to develop the chemistry of their British counterparts. All in all, though, I think the show holds promise and the potential to grow. If you've never seen the original, I think that you'll have much to appreciate here--if for no other reason, the concept is so strikingly different. For fans of the original, I suppose a mixed reaction is to be expected--but I, for one, was willing to go with the flow and enjoy myself.

I love it, love the actors and acting and feel it is a great show. It was with some trepidation that I finally decided to watch the U.S. version. Needless to say I was underwhelmed. I already think it's weird and more than a little creepy that apparently there is so little original material floating around on TV and at the movies that anything that reeks of any success is snatched up and copied over and over again ad nauseum. I hate the word \"reboot\" for anything but computers and this TV show, which I dub a complete ripoff is no exception.Yes, they don't exactly copy the BBC version but there's still plenty of similar enough plot lines for me to wonder about the ethics of whoever is writing the show. Can't come up with something original? Fine, watch the U.K. version then alter the plot lines a bit, rename the characters and call it a brand-new endeavor. Riiight. And part of what I love about the U.K. version is that the people actually look like real people, men and women that I know and would actually talk to--even the pretty and handsome ones. In short, they're real people and I love that since it gives the show an added depth of reality that keeps one believing in the plot no matter how outlandish it gets. The US. version however again gives us Ken and Barbie Doll perfection with people who look like mannequins grabbed off a runway from Paris or Italy. Honestly they could slap those same characters into an episode of Beverly Hills 90210 or The OC or Dawson's Creek and no one would even notice the difference. Whereas if George, Nina, Annie, Tom or Mitchell found themselves on one of those shows the first words out their mouths would likely be, \"Bloody hell, what's all this nonsense? Do you people even know how to hoover let alone stake a vampire who's trying to kill your mates?\"Where the U.K. version actually manages to say something intelligent about the human condition in all its facets and at the same time pack in some very funny, touching clever little moments the U.S. version is just another pale bloodless version of pretty people with problems--or in this case pretty supernatural people with problems.

The characters that make up this world are not incredibly over dramatic (twilight) or insanely over the top (True Blood: The Complete First Season). This show manages to find an impressive balance between the two giving it a feel all its own.The conflict feels organic as well. For Aidan, his past very long past is finally catching up with him, and he must decide between that past and his present. Sally struggles with no longer being connected, and also the loss of her loved ones. Josh desperately wants to be normal, but that is hard to do when every so often you transform into an uncontrollable killing machine.

It's a city where you can dress as Gandalf and unicycle through the streets while bagpiping... and nobody will look at you twice. Seriously, google it.And that is the city you find in &#34;Portlandia: Season 1,&#34; a hilarious sketch show starring Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein. Even if you've never been to Portland, you'll recognize the weird, wacky types of people in this series from SOMEWHERE -- as well as the affectionate ribbing of a fantastical city devoted to hipsterism, kookery and organic awareness.It begins in Los Angeles, where a guy (Armisen) tells his female buddy (Brownstein) about the magical city of Portland, where all the hot girls wear glasses, you can sleep in till eleven, &#34;young people go to retire,&#34; and you're encouraged to be weird. In short, the dream of the '90s is alive in Portland -- and honestly, even if you're not a Portlander (past or present), it will still entertain.Admittedly I have never been to Portland, and thus I cannot truly say whether the kooky sketches are representative of the population there. But it has a number of people and scenarios that, honestly, your average person will be familiar with, including:*Toni and Candace, a pair of humorless, hypersensitive women running a feminist bookstore, who make life difficult for everyone who enters.*Peter and Nance, a pair of socially-conscious people who end up sucked into a polygamist cult.*Portland's cool mayor (Kyle MacLachlan), who hates Seattle and has a secret, not-very-shocking habit.*Hostile hipsters who bicycle like crazy people and trash their workplaces.*Lance and Nina, who engage in odd sexual antics, involving a safe word (&#34;Cacao!&#34;) and a mysterious box.*Aimee Mann becoming a cleaning lady at the house of two psychotic fans.*The Blunderbuss Festival, a music and arts festival where Sparkle Pony tries desperately to play her guitar, and Gus Van Sant presents a short movie about a woman (Selma Blair) who is repulsed by her hot sweet adoring husband.And... a hide and seek league, hardcore bicycle enthusiasts, Japanese tourists and their pug, dumpster-divers, people who read EVERYTHING, cell phone kiosks, hippie girls, labyrinthine ad agencies, massage rockers, unemployment commercials, artisanal light bulbs, watching movies (and cooking) outdoors, putting a bird on everything... and so on.Okay, it might be a slight exaggeration to say that everybody will recognize the people in this series -- for instance, I don't know (of) any delightfully kooky politicians, and I've never worked at an ad agency that specializes in driving you insane. But I have encountered a lot of these in daily life, especially in places like Ann Arbor and Princeton -- and a few are only slight exaggerations.And the slight exaggeration is enough to make the sketches funny -- not surreally absurdist-funny like &#34;Monty Python,&#34; but a quirky, delightfully awkward funny. A lot of the humor is derived from people being snobby about whatever group they're in -- feminists, hipsterism (&#34;_____ is OVER!&#34;), hide-and-seekers -- but there's also a dollop of awkward sex, organic enthusiasm, and occasionally one of those situations that everybody has to deal with, like... trying to negotiate a cell phone plan.Armisen and Brownstein are phenomenal in here, depicting all sorts of people (and sometimes swapping genders, as with Nina and Lance). They're both so straight-faced and enthusiastic, diving into absurd scenarios (like being brainwashed into a polygamous cult and then darting back to a restaurant YEARS LATER) wholeheartedly.And it has a solid supporting cast, often with actors recognizable from elsewhere -- McLachlan as a mayor who goes missing for days and likes sitting on a medicine ball; Steve Buscemi as a guy who needs the bathroom; singers Aimee Mann and Sarah McLachlan; Jenny Conlee and Colin Meloy; Gus Van Sant; Selma Blair; and Heather Graham as a woman who infuriates Toni and Candace by actually loving her boyfriend.&#34;Portlandia: Season 1&#34; is a delightful little sketch show -- and even if you're not familiar with the place, the lightly absurdist approach is charming and funny.

Well, then... you, my friend, need to partake in a strange journey... a journey into Portlandia... a magical, backward world, where \"the dream of the 90s is alive\".This is some of the very finest sketch comedy I have ever seen, on par with \"The Chappelle Show\" and the best segments of \"SNL\". What makes it all the more impressive is that the show relies completely upon its stars, Fred and Carrie, who show a diversity that is nothing short of astounding. These two put it down with every ounce of their heart and soul, and their efforts are clear to see (and much appreciated).I must point out, however, that I'm able to take what one might deem \"extra pleasure\" in this series, for I live near (and work within) the city of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, which is essentially a \"smaller Portland\". Filled with hipsters, weirdos, and goateed maniacs riding fixed gear bikes, Portsmouth is a hilarious, smaller sibling to the its bigger brother, Portland. Therefore, when I watch \"Portlandia\", it's extra funny, because I actually \"recognize\" the characters who appear. \"Hey, I know that guy/gal!

It's okay. The quality wavers between a notch above and a notch below most contemporary sketch comedy, though the characters are generally well done -- caricatures that are right on target. Armisen is good in his roles, while Brownstein is less so. The main shortcoming of the program is the shortcoming shared by most current-day comedy: An emphasis on the situation itself rather than on specific quanta of humor. Fifty years ago, the basic unit of comedy was the joke. Optimum execution of the joke put a premium on delivery and timing. Today, however, the joke has largely died out, replaced with the overall situation as that-which-is-to-be-considered-funny. This shift in focus has changed humor from a well-defined verbal/mental exercise to an amorphous display which the audience is to perceive as funny. As a result, delivery and timing are neglected. Moreover, if it's the situation itself which is presumed to be funny, then the corollary is that more of the situation is going to be more funny. All this is a roundabout and perhaps clumsy way of saying that many of the skits just aren't that humorous or witty to begin with, and that they sometimes go on far too long. Too often, the vibe of the show is, \"Watch us because we're funny,\" rather than really being funny. Still, it's diverting enough most of the time.

Harris \"Film aficionado\"", "helpful": [11, 15], "reviewText": "I'm going to be cautious in my rating for IFC's \"Portlandia\" due to the divisive nature of the show's reception. I know a lot of people who sampled the show during its six episode Season One run, and the consensus seemed to be split right down the middle. Some called the show hilarious, while some found it a belabored missed opportunity. Almost nobody was left standing in the middle. Obviously, if you already love or hate the show, nothing in any review is going to change your mind. My commentary is mainly focused on new viewers who might be thinking about trying the program out. I might suggest you try to catch an episode on IFC (they rerun frequently) for free, but also on Amazon Instant Video if you don't have that network on your cable provider. I can understand why some would really connect with the show's ideology but I can also see why some would be less enthused by its meandering presentation. For myself, I did love the premise of the show but oftentimes thought sketches needed to be tightened up.The Good: \"Portlandia,\" first and foremost, starts with a fantastic idea. Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein have created a comedy that speaks to a very specific portion of the population. In a perfect recreation of indie hipster angst, the show skewers a world in which people are consumed by political correctness. The beauty of \"Portlandia\" is that it both embraces the self-importance, superiority, and silliness of this extreme sect while poking gentle fun with it. It really is spot-on in showcasing this dichotomy and Portland stands as an ideal muse for illustrating this too cool for school mentality. The self-aware characters (Armisen and Browstein play a stable of recurring bits) are so proper, in fact, they are often undone by trying to be idealized models of this elevated consciousness. It's an inspired idea, and when it works--it hits very real highs. People relate to the show because they are or know people exactly like the ones represented.The Not-So-Good: Maybe the people that don't connect as much are lacking the relationships necessary to put the show's environment in context. If, for example, you live in Portland or a place like it--it would be hard not to be amused by the premise of the show. However, premise aside, the show sometimes lacks a comedic timing to make even its funniest bits work to perfection. Skits tend to meander a bit, sometimes with a seeming lack of focus. I realize that this is also kind of the point of the premise, but I felt so many sequences went on just a beat too long. If you're looking for big joke based laughs, this is more character driven or situational comedy. Very few moments end in big punchlines. The big laughs, in fact, are infrequent--most of the time, I was gently amused.Armisen and Browstein create some colorful characters (some more successful than others), but the absolute highlight of the season is to catch the unexpected guest stars. Kyle MacLachlin is fantastic as the mayor, Aimee Mann playing herself as a maid is a hoot. Likable Aubrey Plaza (Parks and Recreation) pops up, but is underutilized. Steve Buscemi has perhaps the season's most mystifying cameo. And there are a few more surprises, and it's fun to see how many people were willing to drop by for a scene or two. Overall, \"Portlandia\" is a definite (but cautious) recommendation for the right audience. Again, I think its ability to both embrace and satirize the ridiculous is its strongest asset. Season One is six episodes running shy of thirty minutes each. Catch up now, as Season Two starts on IFC in January 2012.

Perhaps a little Ellroy will go a long way--he's a bit of a love it or hate it proposition. Having been a successful writer for thirty years, he has a fascination with the dark side and his obsession invariably led to \"L. A.: City of Demons\"--an original documentary series for the Investigation Discovery network (admit it, you spend hours perusing ID). Ellroy has an inherent fascination with the underbelly of Los Angeles which began with the brutal slaying of his mother and is showcased in some of his most noteworthy books (Black Dahlia, L. A. Confidential). With his larger-than-life personality in full affect and his offbeat verbal stylings in unique form, Ellroy actually kicks off this six episode production with a feature that includes his mother's murder.His potboiler style, nihilism, and noir conventions actually align fairly well with the stories he wishes to share in this series. This probably won't be used as promotional material by the Los Angeles Department of Tourism any time soon.(1) Dead Women Own Me: Ellroy explores cases that have had a real impact on his life and psyche including the aforementioned Black Dahlia and his mother's case.(2) The Scandal Rags: Explores the pulp publications that made notoriety with high profile stories such as the Lana Turner scandal.(3) L. A. Serial Killers: Seems self-explanatory.(4) Dames and Delinquents: Exposes notorious cases that involve organized crime including the murder of a famed mob princess.(5) The Dark Side of Hollywood: A look at celebrity culture.(6) Hot Spot Homicide: A profile on notorious bars, clubs and prohibition era speakeasies.My three star recommendation is an overly cautious warning to viewers that are new to the James Ellroy experience. I could spend hours, personally, with this oddball character. The beauty of Ellroy is that he's his own biggest fan, an unapologetic egotist who fervently believes he is the world's greatest living crime novelist. He may well be--but his unabashed self-idolatry and aggrandizement may be off-putting to those who aren't used to it. In addition to Ellroy, the series really ups the odd quotient with the participation of an animated bull terrier named Barko. Did I just throw you off? Trust me, it is as weird as it sounds. Most of the series and the exchanges with Barko, in particular, seem to exist solely in Ellroy's head. By placing himself front and center (he doesn't share screen time with other real people), Ellroy puts the primary focus on himself. And while I love it, it also pushes the actual show content to a position of less importance. Therefore, I think fans will love it--but I'm not sure if it will be winning new devotees to the cult of Ellroy's greatness. Hence, my neutral rating is largely for the uninitiated.

I also don't think they understand the impact on their own lives such as sacrificing their nutrition and health care to buy food for cats/dogs etc.They're not allowing these animals to have better homes with families that can give them more love and attention and are instead trying to divide their attention among some 80-100 animals.  In the end most cases will adopt out a majority of the pets or see a majority of the pets go to no kill shelters but not before embarrassing and/or humiliating the person completely.  I also doubt the people in these stories will ever get over the loss of their large cache or pets.

Since I was familiar with the Hoarders format, family reaches out to clinical psychologist, clean up is set and clinical psychologist helps the hoarder and their family through whatever issues come up during the clean up process, ending in either the family and the hoarder or the hoarder alone continuing going to therapy after the cleanup. Specific to animal hoarders, the use of local humane society or SPCA's were used to rescue the animals. For the episodes I found that there was slow play back which was annoying since it was evident that the content was loading but took somewhere between two to seven minutes to properly load. This issue occurred at least twice within one episode. Obviously there are similarities between Hoarders and Animal Hoarders, in how they respond to different life events in the form of &#34;collecting/accumulating&#34; either animals or what they deem &#34;valuable&#34; items.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Slow Playback and Technical Issues", "unixReviewTime": 1388275200, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2013"}
